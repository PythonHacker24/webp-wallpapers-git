# My Personal Wallpapers
This repository contains my collection of wallpapers. I like them so it is not necessary  that you will like them too.
## If you want to contribute to this repo:-
1. Add wallpapers only in **.webp** format.
2. Wallpapers size should be 1920px in width.
3. They should look cool on systems.

## Instructions to convert images to webp format
- First of all install **Image Magick** in your system:
    ```bash
       sudo pacman -S imagemagick
    ```
- Now, you will have installed a tool named **convert** in your system.
    ```bash
     $ ./run.sh <your file extension without dot.> E.g.: ./run.sh png
    ```
> Kindly install ```libwebp``` for working with/using .webp format.
> If you are not using any WM then you can convert all these files into .png or something you want.


## Happy Hacking.

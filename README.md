# My Personal Wallpapers
This repository contains my collection of wallpapers. I like them so it is not necessary  that you will like them too
## If you want to contribute to this repo:-
1. Add wallpapers only in **.webp** format.
2. Wallpapers size should be 1920px in width.
3. They should look cool on systems.

## Instructions to convert images to webp format
- First of all install **Image Magick** in your system:
```bash
   sudo pacman -S imagemagick
```
- Now, you will have installed a tool named **convert** in your system.
 ```bash
    convert your-input-file.ext your-output-file.webp
```

> You can also use -resize option to resize image in width of 1920
	```bash
	convert your-input-file.ext -resize 1920 your-output-file.webp
	```

- Now you need to implement a for loop in your shell and all done.
## Happy Hacking.
